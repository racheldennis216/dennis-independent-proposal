        <h3> Rachel Dennis <br> Project Proposal</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Project name</h3>
        <p>Business Profile</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>For my independent project, I want to create a business website for my Dad. I will be doing this on Squarespace and watching the LinkedIn tutorial specific to Squarespace. I have a basic knowledge of the website, but it is something I’d like to learn more about. My Dad has been asking me to build him a website for a year now, so this is the perfect opportunity to work on my skills! </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>My Dad (the client) is a mortgage broker in the Northern VA area. He works alongside a team of other mortgage brokers at Freedom Bank. Freedom Bank’s website is a bit old and his bio on the site is only a page with a short bio and photo. Because he works independently, he wants to have a space to create a personal brand. He would like to update his bio and include pages discussing what types of loans his program offers along with advice/contact info/forms to directly email him. He does not want to be dependent on his company to provide a page for him should he change jobs/banks. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>My general audience will be my Dad’s potential clients. He will put the link to his website on his business card and social media. It will also be beneficial in that when someone looks up his name the website will present itself (instead of having to navigate through the bank’s outdated website to find info). Another segment of the ‘audience’ will be recruiters or any hiring companies that look at my online portfolio. I want to add this website/project overview to my portfolio so show off my UX skills. </p>
